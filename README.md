# HertzAFM
%Matlab code written for analysis of force-displacement curves obtained by AFM microindentation
%I wrote this code to be specifically compatible with the type of data collected in force-distance curve mode with the WITec AFM (alpha300)
%Code compatible with Matlab R2009 and newer versions
